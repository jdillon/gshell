    Variables can be referenced using ${variable} syntax.

@|bold QUOTING|@

    Single quotes are opaque.

    Example:

        set foo bar
        echo '${foo}'

    Result:

        ${foo}

    Double quotes are evaluated using variable expansion.

    Example:

        set foo bar
        echo "${foo}"

    Result:

        bar

    Single or double quotes may be escaped with a preceding '\' char.

@|bold COMMENTS|@

    A line that begins with '#' is considered to be a comment; all
    content until a new-line is ignored.

@|bold COMPOUND COMMANDS|@

    Multiple commands can be executed on the same line by separating each
    command (and it's options and arguments) with ';':

        command; [command; ...]

    Example:

        echo -n "hi"; echo " there"

    Result:

        hi there
