Several environment variables are used to control the basic environment
exposed to a shell.

%{underline JAVACMD}

  JAVACMD defines the fully qualified path to the JVM executable to be
  used by the shell. If this is not set, then JAVA_HOME will be
  consulted.

%{underline JAVA_HOME}

  JAVA_HOME is the location of the JVM installation to be used to run
  the shell. If this value is not set, then JAVACMD will default to java
  which must be on the search path, else launching the shell will fail.
  Best practice is to always define JAVA_HOME to the JVM which is
  intended to be used to run the shell.

%{underline JAVA_OPTS}

  Optional flags to pass to the JVM.

%{underline SHELL_HOME}

  The location of the shell installation. This is auto-detected if not
  configured. Best practice is to leave this unset.

%{underline SHELL_OPTS}

  Optional flags to pass to the shell.
